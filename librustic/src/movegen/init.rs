    /** This is the main part of the module: it indexes all of the attack boards
     * using the magic numbers from the "magics" module. This builds an attack database
     * for sliding pieces, for each square and each combination of blocker boards. A
     * blocker is a piece that is "in the way", causing the slider to not be able to
     * 'see' beyond that piece.
     * Step by step description:
     * This function is used for generating and indexing the rook and bishop attacks.
     * Set the viewpoint to either rook or bishop, using is_rook.
     * We need to keep track of the offset within the attack table; each square starts at a
     * certain offset. We also keep track of the total permutations calculated, for checking
     * purposes.
     * Then we start the main loop: for each square in all squares...
     * Get the piece mask for that square (where it can move on an empty board)
     * Calculate the number of permutations that this mask is going to generate.
     * Calculate the end offset of this square in the attack table.
     * Generate all the blocker boards for this piece on this square.
     * Generate all the attacker boards for this piece on this square.
     * Create e new magic.
     * Fill the new magic with the calculated information, but pick the magic number
     * for this square from the pre-generated magics in the magics module. See the function
     * "find_magics()" in that module. (That function is very similar to this one.)
     * We're still on the same square...
     * Now start iterating through the permutations of the blocker boards.
     * Calculate the magic index in the attack table, and then put the *ATTACK* board there.
     * (Every blocker board has only one attack board.)
     * Obviously use either the rook or the bishop attack table.
     * There is also some code to check if the index is within the expected offset,
     * and that the slot found in the attack table is actually empty. If one of these is not true,
     * then there is something wrong with the pre-generated magic numbers.
     * If everything is OK (the program has not panicked), insert the magic into either the rook
     * or bishop magics table. Then go to the next permutation.
     * After the permutations and square loops are done, do a final check. This is a perfect hash
     * (every spot in the table is filled, with no collisions), so we expect the number of handled
     * permutations to be exactly the same as the table's length. If not, there's something wrong.
     *
     * Now, it's possible to build a blocker board for any slider
     * on any board (slider_mask & board_occupancy), and then use this blocker board and the magic
     * information to calculate the index of the attack board for this piece within the attack
     * table.
