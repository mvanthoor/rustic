# Changelog

The Elo differences given below are obtained in 10s+0.1s self-play matches
between this version, and the previous Alpha 3.0.0.

- New features:
  - Tapered evaluation (at least **+230 Elo**)
- Improvements:
  - Better time usage. (**+26 Elo**)
  - Hash Clear function: properly clear TT, instead of recreating it.
- Changes

  - Update "rand_chacha" crate to 0.3.1.
  - Refactored code in Evaluation. Better privacy and namespacing.
  - Renamed some variables here and there for consistency.

## Rustic Alpha 3.0.0 (2021, June 18)

- New features:
  - Killer Moves
  - Principal Variation Search (PVS)
- Changes:
  - Switch versioning scheme to SemVer. Versions are going to be in the
    form "a.b.c" from now on, with the following meaning:
    - Increment **a**: A new strength-gaining feature was added.
    - Increment **b**: A bug was fixed that gained strength.
    - Increment **c**: A feature was added or a bug was fixed that did not
      gain stregnth. It is not necessary to test this version for a rating
      change.
- Misc:
  - Updated crossbeam-channel to version 0.5.1
  - A Makefile was added, so Rustic can be built using "GNU Make". When
    typing "make" (or "gmake" in MacOS), the Makefile will build all Rustic
    versions for the platform it's being compiled on.
  - Re-add showing the size of the TT and number of threads in About.
  - Fairly large update of the book on https://rustic-chess.org/.

  - Set TT size through --hash option or UCI parameter.
- Improvement:

    selective depth at last completed iteration.
  - Count all nodes visited, instead of only nodes which generated moves.

    reproducible behavior between platforms/OS's/architectures/versions.
