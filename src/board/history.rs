// The history struct is basically an array holding the values of the game
// states at each move. If a move is made in make(), this function pushes the
// current game state into this array. In unmake(), that game state can then be
// popped and restored. It is faster than a vector, because:
//
// - It is stored on the stack (a vector is stored on the heap)
// - It doesn't do any error checking. It is up to the caller to check if the
//   history array is either full or empty, before pushing or popping (if
//   necessary, such as during console play: the chess engine will always have
//   one push for every pop during search.)
