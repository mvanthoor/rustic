// movelist.rs contains the implementation of an array backed by a counter, as a
// very minimal drop-in replacement for a vector. An array on the stack is
// faster than a vector allocated on the heap. Speed is much more important than
// functionality, so only the bare minimum to be able to use the array is
// implemented. There is error checking or bounds checking. If the array is
// mis-addressed due to a bug, the program panics.
