__Rustic has moved to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/mvanthoor/rustic)__.

There are several reasons for moving Rustic off of Github:

1. GitHub contains a huge amount of code in one place. It has almost
   become the de-facto solution for software development. I do not agree
   with the fact that there should be one single gigantic platform on which
   most or all open source software in the world depends.
1. For the last few years I have not been happy with the direction in which
   Microsoft is taking its products, including GitHub. Therefore I have
   begun migrating off of Microsoft products and services for private use
   in 2019, starting with switching all of my private computers to Debian
   Linux, including my main workstation. GitHub is the last Microsoft
   product or service that I still privately used.
1. I am not confident that the current government in the USA will take
   (inter)national laws and regulations into account with regard to free
   speech and democracy. Therefore I have been migrating off of USA-based
   services and software products for private use where possible.

I'm thankful to everyone who has starred this repository or had any interest in this
personal project for whatever reason at all. If you wish to keep following
Rustic's (slow) progress, you're invited to visit its [new location on the
internet](https://codeberg.org/mvanthoor/rustic).

>__Note:__ I will not abandon projects I care about, even if they are still
hosted on GitHub. I will contribute to these projects if there's some way
for me to help and improve them. To facilitate this, I will not delete my
GitHub account.
